<h1 align="center"> Personal Website </h1>

## Description
This is Puddlejumper26's personal website, to note down my personal activities, but major parts realted to the study and coding are inside my [Tech Blog](https://github.com/puddlejumper26/blogs#puddlejumper26s-blog-).

The reason to use pure JS without any framework is to simplied maintainance. But might be changed in the future.

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap([Bootwatch/Lux](https://bootswatch.com/lux/))
